          <h2>Project Management Options for Civil</h2>
      
          <p>You're right that Microsoft is shifting towards Microsoft Planner as a more accessible tool for task management, but it doesn't have the full range of features you'd find in Microsoft Project, such as Gantt charts, resource leveling, or advanced project management functions.</p>
      
          <p>Microsoft Planner is more lightweight and user-friendly, designed for team collaboration, task assignment, and simple project tracking, but it lacks complex project management features like:</p>
      
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Gantt Charts:</strong> Planner doesn't have a built-in Gantt chart view.</li>
            <li><strong>Resource Leveling:</strong> Planner doesn't offer automatic resource leveling to help manage workloads and resolve resource conflicts.</li>
          </ul>
      
          <p>For advanced project management needs, you’d want to stick with Microsoft Project. Microsoft has made Project more integrated with the Microsoft 365 ecosystem through <strong>Project for the Web</strong>, which can be used online. This version includes:</p>
      
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Gantt charts:</strong> Similar to the traditional Project desktop app.</li>
            <li><strong>Resource Management:</strong> You can manage resources, and there is a degree of resource leveling.</li>
            <li><strong>Task and Timeline Management:</strong> It's much more robust than Planner for complex timelines.</li>
          </ul>
      
          <h3>✅ Recommendation for the Civil Department</h3>
      
          <p>If you're managing multiple projects and need features like Gantt charts and resource management, <strong>Microsoft Project for the Web</strong> is the best fit within the Microsoft 365 ecosystem. Here's what you can do next:</p>
      
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Try Project for the Web:</strong> If your organization already has Microsoft 365 licenses, you may already have access to it. Ask IT or your Microsoft 365 admin if it's included in your plan.</li>
            <li><strong>Evaluate needs:</strong> List key features you’re missing in Planner (e.g. timeline view, task dependencies, resource conflicts) and map them to what Project for the Web can do.</li>
            <li><strong>Start with one project:</strong> Test Project for the Web on a single civil project to see how it handles timelines, teams, and assignments.</li>
            <li><strong>Optional add-on:</strong> Consider using Power BI for visual dashboards or Microsoft Teams to integrate project views and collaboration in one place.</li>
          </ul>
