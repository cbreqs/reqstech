    <h1>BIM + VDC: Building Integration Mindfully</h1>
   
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>BIM isn’t just a toolset, it’s a mindset. I don’t just manage models; I manage momentum. I translate technical complexity into collaborative clarity, and I bridge the gaps between software, systems, and the humans behind them.</p>
    <p>We’re not in the era of isolated drawings anymore. We’re in the era of <strong>integrated infrastructure</strong>. That’s what VDC unlocks and that’s where I live.</p>

    <h2>What I Actually Do (aka: Not Just "Drafting")</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop and maintain intelligent BIM models across civil, structural, and architectural disciplines</li>
      <li>Streamline standards, templates, and best practices so that chaos stops eating everyone's time</li>
      <li>Train teammates and support users with empathy, precision, and actual follow-through</li>
      <li>Troubleshoot technical workflows while building bridges between CAD, Revit, Civil 3D, and more</li>
      <li>Translate needs between teams who don’t speak the same software language—and get them aligned</li>
      <li>Explore integrations (like SharePoint, Power BI, and Dynamo) to reduce redundancy and increase flow</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where I Add the Most Value</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Workflow Optimization:</strong> I don’t just fix problems; I find the source and design it out of existence.</li>
      <li><strong>Cross-Disciplinary Communication:</strong> I listen to engineers. I interpret for drafters. I translate for managers. Connecting it all is where I find my peace.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical Strategy (Without the Ego):</strong> I see the big picture and the road to get there. I don’t need to micromanage to lead.</li>
      <li><strong>Support With Spine:</strong> I’ll help anyone who asks for it. But I also draw clear lines around what support looks like when people ignore protocols.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why VDC Matters (And Why I Fight for It)</h2>
    <p>VDC is an evolution. It’s what happens when information isn’t just managed, but <strong>activated</strong>.</p>
    <p>When BIM becomes part of a larger, integrated ecosystem - when data, scheduling, estimating, design, and project coordination all talk to each other - you stop wasting time reinventing the wheel every project.</p>
    <p>That’s not “extra.” That’s <strong>efficiency at scale</strong>.</p>
    <p>But here’s the truth: you can’t implement that vision in a company that still thinks “working from home” means “playing hooky.” You can’t lead innovation under managers who fear what they don’t understand.</p>
    <p>I’ve spent years building skills that make companies better and learning to speak a variety of technical, business, and niche languages, all with a quirky controlled chaos.</p>

    <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
    <p>Right now, I’m digging into connections that match my energy, skillset, and vision. I have multiple projects in differing states of development. They build on various aspects of my background, a scaffolding that is aligning in the form of colorful, mildly chaotic, goofy energy.</p> 
	<p>If you want to work with someone who blends tech fluency, system thinking, and rock-solid empathy, you’ve found me! YAY!</p>
